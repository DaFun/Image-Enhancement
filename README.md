# Real-time image enhancement DL model android App and web App
An deep learning project focusing on deploying pretrained models on mobile device and cloud. It's implemented during 3 weeks Insight AI fellowship program.

The pretrained models give credit to [Deep Bilateral Learning
for Real-Time Image Enhancement](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/graphics/hdrnet/)
